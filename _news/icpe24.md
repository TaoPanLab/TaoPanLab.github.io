Our research paper, "[Unveiling Temporal Performance Deviation: Leveraging Clustering in Microservices Performance Analysis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3629527.3651843)", has been accepted for presentation at the 15th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering ([ICPE](https://icpe2024.spec.org/)). In the ever-expanding cloud computing landscape, performance is key. Our methodology tackles the challenge of identifying performance issues in microservices. By clustering containers based on performance at different time intervals, we unveil temporal deviations. Applied to the Alibaba dataset, we uncovered stable and dynamic performance patterns – an approach for enhancing overall performance and reliability in modern application landscapes!
