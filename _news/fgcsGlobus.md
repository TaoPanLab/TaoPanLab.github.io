Our article, "[The Globus Compute Dataset: An Open Function-as-a-Service Dataset From the Edge to the Cloud](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2023.12.007)", has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Future Generation Computer Systems. We delve into the world of federated function-as-a-service (FaaS) through our unique dataset from the Globus Compute platform. This dataset spans 31 weeks, capturing 2 million task submissions, 252 users, and 580 computing endpoints. Explore intriguing observations, from short task runtimes to the diverse use of endpoints.
