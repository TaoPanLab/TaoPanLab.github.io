Secure and scalable group communication is vital for IoT applications like smart cities and healthcare, especially in Wireless Sensor Networks with low-capacity sensors. Choosing the right Secure Group Communication (SGC) scheme is tough due to varied options. While past research focused on server/client runtimes, we are the first to analyze network-based performance. Using ComBench, we tested SKDC, LKH (centralized), and G-DH (decentralized) schemes under different network conditions. Our findings? Packet loss and delay significantly affect execution times, more so than group size.

Scientific research increasingly depends on distributed resources from HPC and cloud systems to edge devices. Event-driven architecture (EDA) enhances applications targeting these infrastructures by managing communication, processing, and security of distributed events. Enter Octopus—a hybrid cloud-to-edge event fabric designed to scale with demand, enable resilient applications, and enforce fine-grained access control. Supporting up to 9.6M events/second, Octopus is tailored for use cases like self-driving labs, data automation, and dynamic workflows.

Serverless computing abstracts infrastructure, letting developers focus on code. Yet, “cold start” latency, the cost to deploy environments, can hinder scientific computing with its sporadic demands. Our study tackles this by pre-installing Python packages in container images. Analyzing data from Globus Compute and Binder, we evaluate four container strategies. Pre-installed packages reduce cold start time but need more storage, while dynamic installs save space but add delays. Our simulator shows moderate warm times can cut cold starts without heavy overhead.

In previous research, we identified security flaws in one Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) approach. Our latest study continues this analysis, revealing an attack vector in another ABE scheme that allows unauthorized decryption. We highlight the crucial need for thorough security evaluations of new schemes and propose a solution to fix this vulnerability.

As time series data are crucial yet often limited or confidential, we focus in this work on time series synthesis an important alternative. Despite the availability of numerous synthesis methods, evaluating their quality remains challenging. Our comprehensive survey defines what constitutes “good” synthesis and proposes a systematic evaluation procedure. This work aims to drive rigorous and reproducible research in the field of time series synthesis.

With the proliferation of IoT devices comes an increase in cybersecurity threats. Unlike standard 1-to-1 communication, IoT requires efficient n-to-n encryption, which is achieved through Secure Group Communication schemes. However, the abundance of available schemes makes selecting the right one daunting. Our paper addresses this challenge by presenting a benchmark specifically tailored for IoT, assisting developers in their scheme selection process. We define business problems, design a specification-based benchmark, and extend it to a hybrid benchmark suitable for real-world IoT environments.

Synthetic data generation models the distributions of real datasets to create new data, which is crucial in privacy-sensitive fields like healthcare. While image synthesis has been extensively studied, time series synthesis is equally vital for practical applications. Despite the availability of numerous models and measures, there is no consensus on defining or quantifying high-quality synthetic time series. Our comprehensive survey reviews various evaluation measures, provides clear definitions, organizes them into a taxonomy, and offers guidance on selecting appropriate measures.

Applied to the Alibaba dataset, we uncovered stable and dynamic performance patterns – an approach for enhancing overall performance and reliability in modern application landscapes!

The comprehensive evaluation of 34 schemes, considering computational and communication costs along with security features, is presented. Our use of decision trees simplifies the selection process for centralized, distributed, and decentralized SGC schemes. Arm yourself with these insights for robust IoT security.

In this study, we delve into the performance of homomorphic encryption through real-world applications of linear regression. The verdict? While homomorphic linear regression takes minutes, slower than its non-homomorphic counterpart, it stands out for its security features.

This study addresses the challenge of choosing the appropriate Secure Group Communication (SGC) scheme. We systematically evaluate 34 schemes, analyzing computational and communication costs along with security features. Utilizing decision trees, we streamline the selection process for centralized, distributed, and decentralized SGC schemes.

In our study, we thoroughly investigated the use of prophylactic intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction. The results are conclusive: there is a notable reduction in postoperative low cardiac output syndrome, a lower requirement for support, and no increase in in-hospital mortality. The use of prophylactic IABP emerges as a beneficial strategy for improving outcomes in high-risk cardiac procedures.

Through this extensive examination, we discovered that container start times exhibit a broad range—from milliseconds to seconds—even within the same environment. Notably, our findings reveal that no single dominant configuration feature decisively determines a container’s start time.

Delving into the stability of benchmark measurements, our study scrutinizes 586 micro-benchmarks. We explore the challenges, evaluate previous approaches, and introduce a new heuristic. Even in a peer review scenario, humans find it challenging to identify disimilar benchmark runs, highlighting the complexity of the issue. Notably, our heuristic stands out with an impressive 92% sensitivity, offering a promising contribution to the assessment of benchmarking run similarity.
